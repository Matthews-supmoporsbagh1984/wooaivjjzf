Man, just... wow. Just came outta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Until Dawn and it's still running circles in my brain. First, you know that feeling when you eat too much junk food and it feels like a cement block in your stomach? That’s how my brain feels. Not sure what to digest first. 

Because soooo many plot twists. Like, is it horror? Is it a psychological puzzle of doom? I can't even decide. Those back-breaking theater seats didn’t help the whole experience. Bet they recline in other universes... 

The snow-covered mountains and that ominous lodge just creeped me out, almost felt the cold seeping through my jacket. That lodge had more secrets than my grandma's attic, seriously. And those jump scares, like popcorn popping in a sweaty microwave bag, all over the damn place. Gonna find kernels in my shoes forever, it seems.

> Okay, remember where there was this tense moment and suddenly—BAM—squirrel appears? It's like, come on, squirrel, this ain’t your  ! Stray burp from the dude next to me broke the tension. Oddly fitting. 

Someone in the row behind kept sneezing, like some horror soundtrack extras. But when Josh's face went wild—his eyes that chaos soup? Can't stop seeing them. Like that one time I saw a wild raccoon in the kitchen at midnight—those eyes. Need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , I gotta dissect every frame.

Think someone asked me to recommend. Uh, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   alone? I mean, darkness and solitude fits its vibe like mismatched socks on a rainy Tuesday. 

Clueless how the actors pulled off that fear so real, almost felt the adrenaline zing through me...or maybe it was the awkward angle I sat—back feels 10x its age. Should’ve brought the heating pad. Characters got under my skin like that weird tickle when a hair sticks to your neck. 

There’s one thing though, the thing with the totems, huh? What's with the totems? Like, fortune cookies with an edge. Open your destiny: get chills.

I need a coffee to unscramble my neurons. Like, stat. The theater, though... acoustics off? Some lines felt swallowed, like that one time my cat ate spaghetti, basically less word, more spaghetti sauce vibes everywhere.
